These scripts will help you develop a personalized combat script.

Each script will have a way to tell you how to use it.

Thanks for using RoFor!

All combat controllers should be something like this:

Tool (if fists disable requires handle)
  |- Server script (requires damage controller, deals damage on remote event fireings)
  |
  |- Remote Event
